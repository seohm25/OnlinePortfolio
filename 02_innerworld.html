            Each person has various thoughts and values according to their environment or experience, and accordingly, each has their unique inner vessel. 
            I have abstractly visualized the various inner aspects of people in our society. 
            Each invisible thoughts and emotions collide and mix in relationships in various societies.<br/> 

            <br>Inspired by the surrealist painting style containing the unconscious flow, I was interested and curious to visualize what seemed invisible. 
            Rather than drawing a specific object realistically, I worked as it flows.
